# This script allows the user to run the default program
# to open a file for it's given type or extension.
#
# It contains the `subprocess_open` method that calls
# for the program in a subprocess using subprocess' Popen.
#
# But also the `get_open_command` that returns the
# script to run in a shell so you can call it as you want.
#
# If you want to test it, you can use this same script to
# open the file.
# Note that "click" is required in order to test it.

    Method to open the file with the default program in a subprocess.
    As being called in a subprocess, it will not block the current one.
    This method runs the command on a subprocess using the default system shell.

    https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen
    The subprocess will run in background so you won't be able to bring back
    the result code, but the current log can be obtained via the Popen's PIPE:
    Usage:
    ```
    # Run as subprocess
    subproc = subprocess_opener(filepath)
    # Get the stdout for the subprocess
    print(subproc.stdout)
    # Get the stderr for the subprocess
